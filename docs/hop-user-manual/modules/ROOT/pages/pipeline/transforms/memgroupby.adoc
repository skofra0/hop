:description: This transform allows you to do aggregations in memory such as sum,max,min,...

== Description

The Memory Group By transform builds aggregates in a group by fashion.

This transform processes all rows within memory and therefore does not require a sorted input.
However, it **does** require all data to fit into memory.

TIP: When the number of rows is too large to fit into memory, use a combination of xref:pipeline/transforms/sort.adoc[Sort Rows] and xref:pipeline/transforms/groupby.adoc[Group By] transforms.

|Option|Description
|Transform name|Name of the transform this name has to be unique in a single pipeline,
|Always give back a result row|If you enable this option, the Group By transform will always give back a result row, even if there is no input row.
|This can be useful if you want to count the number of rows.
Without this option you would never get a count of zero (0).
|The field that make up the group|After retrieving fields using the Get Fields button, designate the fields to include in the group.
See the Group be transform for more details.
|Aggregates|After retrieving fields using the Get lookup fields button, designate the fields to include in the group.
See the Group be transform for more details.
