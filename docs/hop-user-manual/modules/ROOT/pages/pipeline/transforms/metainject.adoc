== Description

Metadata injection allows Apache Hop users to provide the required metadata for a pipeline at runtime. This can significantly reduce the need to develop slightly different versions of what is basically the same pipeline.

== Usage

The Metadata Injection transform inserts data from various sources into a pipeline at runtime. This is typically used to automate repetitive ETL tasks.

A typical example is the onboarding of large amounts of text file data in a variety of formats. Even though you may have a number of different file layouts to load, the process is always the same: read the file, clean or enrich the data, and finally write the data to a target platform or some other file format. The only difference is the actual layout of the data, the steps to follow are always the same.

== Options

=== General

[options="header"]
|===
|Option|Description
|Transform name|Name of the transform.
|Pipeline|Specify your template pipeline by entering in its path.
Click Browse to display and enter the path details using the Virtual File System Browser.

If you select a pipeline that has the same root path as the current pipeline, the variable {openvar}Internal.Transform.Current.Directory{closevar} will automatically be inserted in place of the common root path.
For example, if the current pipeline's path is /home/admin/pipeline.hpl and you select a pipeline in the folder /home/admin/path/sub.hpl then the path will automatically be converted to {openvar}Internal.Transform.Current.Directory{closevar}/path/sub.hpl.

The ETL Metadata Injection transform features the two tabs with fields.
Each tab is described below.

=== Inject Metadata Tab

[options="header"]
|===
|Option|Description
|Target injection transform key| Lists the available fields in each transform of the template pipeline that can be injected with metadata.
|Target description|Describes how the target fields relate to their target transforms.
|Source transform|Lists the transform associated with the fields to be injected into the target fields as metadata.
|Source field|Lists the fields to be injected into the target fields as metadata.
|===

To specify the source field as metadata to be injected, perform the following transforms:

1. In the Target injection transform key column, double-click the field for which you want to specify a source field.
The Source field dialog box opens.

2. Select a source field and click OK.

3. Optionally, select Use constant value to specify a constant value for the injected metadata through one of the following actions:
- Manually entering a value.
- Using an internal variable to set the value ({openvar}Internal.transform.Unique.Count{closevar} for example).
- Using a combination of manually specified values and parameter values ({openvar}FILE_PREFIX{closevar}_{openvar}FILE_DATE{closevar}.txt for example).

When specifying constant values for grouped lists of values like fields or filenames please note that there isn't a good solution for that.  Best practice is to use a xref:pipeline/transforms/datagrid.adoc[Data Grid] transform to inject a complete set of constant values.  You can map those in this metadata injection transform. It will do its best to accommodate you by allowing you to inject a single row in the group with the specified constant value.

==== Injecting Metadata into the ETL Metadata Injection transform

For injecting metadata into the ETL Metadata Injection transform itself, the following exceptions apply:


- To inject a method for how to specify a field (such as by FILENAME), set a PIPELINE_SPECIFICATION_METHOD constant to the field of an input transform.
You can then map the field as a source to the PIPELINE_SPECIFICATION_METHOD constant in the ETL Metadata Injection transform.

- The target field for the ETL Metadata Injection transform inserting the metadata into the original injection is defined by [GROUP NAME].[FIELD NAME].
For example, if the GROUP NAME is 'OUTPUT_FIELDS' and the FIELD NAME is 'OUTPUT_FIELDNAME', you would set the target field to 'OUTPUT_FIELDS.OUTPUT_FIELDNAME'.

=== Options Tab

[options="header"]
|===
|Option|Description
|transform to read from (optional)|Optionally, select a transform in your template pipeline to pass data directly to a transform following the ETL Metadata Injection transform in your current pipeline.
|Field name|If transform to read from is selected, enter the name of the field passed directly from the transform in the template pipeline.
|Type|If transform to read from is selected, select the type of the field passed directly from the transform in the template pipeline.
|Length|If transform to read from is selected, enter the length of the field passed directly from the transform in the template pipeline.
|Precision|If transform to read from is selected, enter the precision of the field passed directly from the transform in the template pipeline.
|Optional target file (hpl after injection)|For initial pipeline development or debugging, specify an optional file for creating and saving a pipeline of your template after metadata injection occurs.
The resulting pipeline will be your template pipeline with the metadata already injected as constant values.
|Streaming source transform|Select a source transform in your current pipeline to directly pass data to the Streaming target transform in the template pipeline.
|Streaming target transform|Select the target transform in your template pipeline to receive data directly from the Streaming source transform.
|Run resulting pipeline|Select to inject metadata and run the template pipeline.
If this option is not selected, metadata injection occurs, but the template pipeline does not run.
